    “ For me, great algorithms are the poetry of computation.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Just like verse, they can be terse, allusive, dense, and even mysterious. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;But once unlocked, they cast a brilliant new light on some aspect of computing. ”<br>

## Union Find

The goal of this algorithm is to find if any two elements are connected. This problem is also called dynamic connectivity problem. This connection is an equivalence relationship. We assume that:

1 - Symmetric: If p is connected to q, then q is also connected to p.<br>
2 - Transitive: If p is connected to q and q is connected to r, p is connected to r as well.<br>
3 - Reflexive: p is connected to p.<br>
